# React Native Best Practices

## Overview

Performance optimization guide for React Native applications, covering JavaScript/React, Native (iOS/Android), and bundling optimizations. Based on Callstack's "Ultimate Guide to React Native Optimization".

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Debugging slow/janky UI or animations
- Investigating memory leaks (JS or native)
- Optimizing app startup time (TTI)
- Reducing bundle or app size
- Writing native modules (Turbo Modules)
- Profiling React Native performance
- Reviewing React Native code for performance

## Security Notes

- Treat shell commands in these references as local developer operations. Review them before running, prefer version-pinned tooling, and avoid piping remote scripts directly to a shell.
- Treat third-party libraries and plugins as dependencies that still require normal supply-chain controls: pin versions, verify provenance, and update through your standard review process.
- Treat remote chunk loading as first-party artifact delivery only. Prefer app-bundled chunks or signed CI release manifests; hosted chunks must come from trusted HTTPS origins you control and be pinned to the current app release.

## Priority-Ordered Guidelines

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | FPS & Re-renders | CRITICAL | `js-*` |
| 2 | Bundle Size | CRITICAL | `bundle-*` |
| 3 | TTI Optimization | HIGH | `native-*`, `bundle-*` |
| 4 | Native Performance | HIGH | `native-*` |
| 5 | Memory Management | MEDIUM-HIGH | `js-*`, `native-*` |
| 6 | Animations | MEDIUM | `js-*` |

Impact labels are triage hints: CRITICAL first, HIGH next, MEDIUM when evidence points there.

## Quick Reference

### Optimization Workflow

Follow this cycle for any performance issue: **Measure → Optimize → Re-measure → Validate**

1. **Measure**: Capture baseline metrics before changes. For runtime issues, prefer commit timeline, re-render counts, slow components, heaviest-commit breakdown, and startup/TTI when available. Component tree depth or count are optional context, not substitutes. Do not recommend memoization, atomic state, or compiler changes without a measured render or FPS problem.
2. **Optimize**: Apply the targeted fix from the relevant reference
3. **Re-measure**: Run the same measurement to get updated metrics
4. **Validate**: Confirm improvement (e.g., FPS 45→60, TTI 3.2s→1.8s, bundle 2.1MB→1.6MB)

If metrics did not improve, revert and try the next suggested fix.

### Review Guardrails

- Check library versions before suggesting API-specific fixes. Example: FlashList v2 deprecates `estimatedItemSize`, so do not flag it as missing there.
- Do not suggest `useMemo` or `useCallback` dependency changes unless behavior is demonstrably incorrect or profiling shows wasted work tied to that value.
- Do not report stale closures speculatively. Show the stale read path, a repro, or profiler evidence before calling it out.
- When profiling a flow, measure the target interaction itself. Do not treat component tree depth or component count as the main performance evidence.

### Critical: FPS & Re-renders

**Profile first:**
```bash
agent-device react-devtools status
agent-device react-devtools wait --connected
agent-device react-devtools profile start
agent-device react-devtools profile stop
agent-device react-devtools profile slow --limit 5
agent-device react-devtools profile rerenders --limit 5
agent-device react-devtools profile timeline --limit 20
```

Drive the target interaction with normal `agent-device` commands between `profile start` and `profile stop`.

Manual fallback when `agent-device` is unavailable: open React Native DevTools from Metro (`j`) or the Dev Menu, use
